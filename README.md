# Scribble-Hub-Downloader
Terminal helper that mirrors an entire ScribbleHub series into chapter bundles you can read offline. It drives a cloudscraper session through ScribbleHub's AJAX table of contents, walks every chapter in order, and writes tidy plain-text chunks while keeping you up to date with a rich progress display.
